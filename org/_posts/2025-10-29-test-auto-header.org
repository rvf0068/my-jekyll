#+TITLE: Test Post with Automatic Header Generation
#+DATE: 2025-10-29 17:00:00 -0500
#+AUTHOR: Test Author
#+JEKYLL_LAYOUT: post
#+JEKYLL_CATEGORIES: test automation
#+JEKYLL_TAGS: org-mode automation jekyll

* Introduction

This post demonstrates the automatic generation of Jekyll front matter from org-mode properties.

Instead of manually writing a =#+BEGIN_EXPORT html= block with Jekyll front matter, the system now automatically extracts metadata from org properties:

- =#+TITLE:= becomes the post title
- =#+DATE:= becomes the post date
- =#+JEKYLL_LAYOUT:= specifies the layout (defaults to "post")
- =#+JEKYLL_CATEGORIES:= specifies categories
- =#+JEKYLL_TAGS:= specifies tags

* Features

** Clean Org Syntax

No more ugly export blocks at the beginning of your posts!

** Standard Org Properties

Uses standard org-mode properties that work well with other org tools.

** Automatic Processing

The front matter is automatically generated during the publishing process.

* Conclusion

This makes writing Jekyll posts in org-mode much more natural and maintainable.
