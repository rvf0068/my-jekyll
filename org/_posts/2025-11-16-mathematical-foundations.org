* Introduction

This post demonstrates the blog's mathematical typesetting capabilities, including formal definitions, theorems, proofs, equation numbering, figure references, and citations. We explore fundamental concepts in algebra and topology.

* Group Theory Foundations

** Basic Definitions

#+begin_definition
A *group* is a set $G$ together with a binary operation $\cdot: G \times G \to G$ satisfying:
1. *Closure*: For all $a, b \in G$, we have $a \cdot b \in G$
2. *Associativity*: $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$ for all $a, b, c \in G$
3. *Identity*: There exists an element $e \in G$ such that $e \cdot a = a \cdot e = a$ for all $a \in G$
4. *Inverse*: For each $a \in G$, there exists $a^{-1} \in G$ such that $a \cdot a^{-1} = a^{-1} \cdot a = e$
#+end_definition

#+begin_definition
The *order* of a group $G$, denoted $|G|$, is the number of elements in $G$. If $G$ is finite, we say $G$ has finite order; otherwise, $G$ has infinite order.
#+end_definition

** Fundamental Theorems

#+begin_theorem
*(Lagrange's Theorem)* Let $G$ be a finite group and $H$ a subgroup of $G$. 
Then the order of $H$ divides the order of $G$.
#+end_theorem

#+begin_proof
Consider the left cosets of $H$ in $G$. Each coset $aH = \{ah : h \in H\}$ has exactly $|H|$ elements, and the cosets partition $G$. Therefore, $|G| = k|H|$ for some integer $k$, proving that $|H|$ divides $|G|$.
#+end_proof

#+begin_corollary
If $G$ is a group of prime order $p$, then $G$ is cyclic.
#+end_corollary

#+begin_lemma
A non-empty subset $H \subseteq G$ is a subgroup if and only if $ab^{-1} \in H$ for all $a, b \in H$.
#+end_lemma

* Algebraic Equations and Formulas

The fundamental theorem of algebra can be expressed through the following equation:

\begin{equation}
\label{org1234567}
p(z) = a_n z^n + a_{n-1} z^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 z + a_0 = 0
\end{equation}

where $p(z)$ is a polynomial of degree $n \geq 1$ with complex coefficients, and this equation has exactly $n$ complex roots (counting multiplicities).

For quadratic equations, we have the well-known formula:

\begin{equation}
\label{org2345678}
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\end{equation}

The discriminant $\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$ in equation \eqref{org2345678} determines the nature of the roots.

** Group Actions and Orbits

Let $G$ act on a finite set $X$. The orbit-stabilizer theorem states:

\begin{equation}
\label{org3456789}
|G| = |\text{Orb}(x)| \cdot |\text{Stab}(x)|
\end{equation}

where $\text{Orb}(x) = \{g \cdot x : g \in G\}$ and $\text{Stab}(x) = \{g \in G : g \cdot x = x\}$.

* Topological Spaces

#+begin_definition
A *topological space* is a pair $(X, \tau)$ where $X$ is a set and $\tau$ is a collection of subsets of $X$ called *open sets* satisfying:
1. $\emptyset, X \in \tau$
2. Any union of sets in $\tau$ is in $\tau$
3. Any finite intersection of sets in $\tau$ is in $\tau$
#+end_definition

#+begin_proposition
Every metric space $(X, d)$ can be given a topology by declaring $U \subseteq X$ open if for every $x \in U$, there exists $\epsilon > 0$ such that $B(x, \epsilon) \subseteq U$.
#+end_proposition

* Figures and Visual Content

Mathematical concepts often benefit from visual representation. Consider the following diagram illustrating group relationships:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 400 :alt Group structure diagram :align center
#+NAME: fig:group-diagram
#+CAPTION: Subgroup lattice showing relationships between cyclic groups
[[file:ciclos6-0.png]]

Figure [[fig:group-diagram]] demonstrates the lattice structure of subgroups in a cyclic group of order 6. 

We can also include generated mathematical plots:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 500 :alt Mathematical function plot :align center  
#+NAME: fig:math-plot
#+CAPTION: Plot of polynomial functions and their derivatives
[[file:mymatplotg.png]]

The visualization in Figure [[fig:math-plot]] shows how polynomial functions behave, which relates to our discussion of equation \eqref{org1234567}.

* Tables and Data

Mathematical results are often summarized in tabular form:

#+NAME: tab:group-examples
#+CAPTION: Examples of finite groups and their properties
| Group | Order | Abelian | Cyclic | Generators |
|-------+-------+---------+--------+------------|
| $\mathbb{Z}_5$ | 5 | Yes | Yes | 1, 2, 3, 4 |
| $S_3$ | 6 | No | No | $(1\,2)$, $(1\,2\,3)$ |
| $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ | 4 | Yes | No | $(1,0)$, $(0,1)$ |
| $\mathbb{Z}_8$ | 8 | Yes | Yes | 1, 3, 5, 7 |

Table [[tab:group-examples]] provides a comparison of different group structures, illustrating the diversity described in our definitions above.

#+NAME: tab:equation-types
#+CAPTION: Classification of polynomial equations by degree
| Degree | Name | General Form | Solving Method |
|--------+------+--------------+----------------|
| 1 | Linear | $ax + b = 0$ | Direct |
| 2 | Quadratic | $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ | Formula \eqref{org2345678} |
| 3 | Cubic | $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0$ | Cardano's method |
| 4 | Quartic | $ax^4 + \cdots = 0$ | Ferrari's method |
| $\geq 5$ | Quintic+ | $ax^n + \cdots = 0$ | No general formula |

* Advanced Topics with Citations

Recent research in algebraic topology has focused on computational methods [cite:@quillen1978homotopy]. The relationship between group theory and topology becomes apparent when studying fundamental groups and covering spaces [cite:@bjorner1995topology].

** Homological Algebra

The study of chain complexes leads to important invariants. Consider the exact sequence:

\begin{equation}
\label{org4567890}
0 \to A \xrightarrow{f} B \xrightarrow{g} C \to 0
\end{equation}

where the sequence in equation \eqref{org4567890} is exact if $\text{im}(f) = \ker(g)$.

#+begin_theorem
*(Fundamental Theorem of Homological Algebra)* Every short exact sequence of modules over a principal ideal domain splits.
#+end_theorem

** Interactive Computing

The [[http://localhost:4000/my-jekyll/2025/11/16/interactive-python.html][Interactive Python Computing]] post shows how to numerically explore these theoretical concepts:

- Lagrange's Theorem can be verified computationally for specific groups using matrix representations
- The orbit-stabilizer equation can be validated through direct computation of group actions
- The statistical methods in the interactive post could analyze data related to the group examples in our comparison tables

These connections illustrate how theoretical mathematics, algorithmic implementation, and computational exploration complement each other in modern mathematical research and education.
