* Introduction to Algebraic Structures

This document uses the Emacs configuration, tailored for academic writing, to efficiently define and reference mathematical concepts. The custom keybindings and snippets streamline the creation of structured, citable content.

* The Group Axioms

The study of algebraic structures begins with the notion of a group. This block uses the definition environment.

#+label: def:group-axioms
#+name: def:group-axioms
#+begin_definition
A *group* is a set \(G\) together with a binary operation \(*\) (called the group operation) that satisfies the four fundamental properties: closure, associativity, identity, and inverses.
#+end_definition

The set of integers \(\mathbb{Z}\) under addition is a classic example.

#+name: exa:symmetric
#+label: exa:symmetric
#+begin_exampleblock
The symmetric group \(S_n\).
#+end_exampleblock

Another example:

#+name: exa:alternating
#+label: exa:alternating
#+begin_exampleblock
The alternating group \(A_{n}\).
#+end_exampleblock

This is a test: \(a<b\) and \(b<c\) imply \(a<c\).

Another test:
#+name: eq:transitive
\begin{equation}
a<b,  b<c \Rightarrow a<c.
\end{equation}

We make a remark:

#+name: rem:other
#+label: rem:other
#+begin_remark
There are many other examples, such as:
1. The dihedral group \(D_{n}\),
2. The cyclic groups \(C_{n}\).
#+end_remark

#+name: rem:other2
#+label: rem:other2
#+begin_remark
There are many other examples, such as:
- The dihedral group \(D_{n}\),
- The cyclic groups \(C_{n}\).
#+end_remark

Let us check lists outside blocks:

1. First
2. Second
  

* Theorems on Group Uniqueness

We state a fundamental result regarding the uniqueness of the identity and inverse.

#+label: thm:identity-and-inverse-uniqueness
#+name: thm:identity-and-inverse-uniqueness
#+begin_theorem
In a group \((G, *)\), the identity element is unique, and for each element \(a \in G\), the inverse element is unique.
#+end_theorem

** Proof of Uniqueness (using *Proof* block)

#+label: pf:identity-uniqueness-proof
#+name: pf:identity-uniqueness-proof
#+begin_proof
The identity element is unique. Assume \(e\) and \(e'\) are both identity elements in \(G\).
Since \(e\) is an identity element, \(e * e' = e'\).
Since \(e'\) is an identity element, \(e * e' = e\).
Thus, \(e = e'\), proving the identity element is unique. 
#+end_proof

* Corollaries and Lemmas

The following corollary is a direct result of Theorem [[thm:identity-and-inverse-uniqueness]]

#+label: cor:inverse-of-inverse
#+name: cor:inverse-of-inverse
#+begin_corollary
For any element \(a\) in a group \(G\), the inverse of the inverse is the element itself, i.e., \((a^{-1})^{-1} = a\).
#+end_corollary

Before a more complicated theorem, we need a technical lemma.

#+label: lem:cancellation-law
#+name: lem:cancellation-law
#+begin_lemma
If \(a, b, c\) are elements of a group \(G\) such that \(a*b = a*c\), then \(b=c\). This is the left cancellation law.
#+end_lemma

* Conclusion and Displayed Math

The *left cancellation law* (see Lemma [[lem:cancellation-law]]) is crucial for proving the uniqueness property (discussed in Theorem [[thm:identity-and-inverse-uniqueness]]). We also saw the Definition [[def:group-axioms]] of a group, which is a key concept.

To display an equation block, we use the LaTeX export block.

#+name: eq:first
\begin{equation}
e^{2\pi i}=1
\end{equation}

#+name: eq:second
\begin{equation}
a=b
\end{equation}

#+name: eq:orbit-stabilizer
\begin{equation}
G/H=G_{x}
\end{equation}

The formula \(\mathrm{Orb}(x) \times \mathrm{Stab}(x) \simeq G\). Equation [[eq:orbit-stabilizer]] relates the Orbit and Stabilizer of an element \(x\).

#+name: thm:yoneda
#+label: thm:yoneda
#+begin_theorem
Any representable functor is nice.
#+end_theorem

We will use next Theorem [[thm:yoneda]]. We reference Lemma [[lem:cancellation-law]] again.

We want to insert a new theorem with =F6 t=:

#+name: thm:new
#+label: thm:new
#+begin_theorem
A new theorem.
#+end_theorem

#+name: def:group
#+label: def:group
#+begin_definition
A representation of \(G\) on a vector space \(V\) is a morphism \(\rho\colon G\to \mathrm{GL}(V)\).
#+end_definition

#+name: eq:newest
\begin{equation}
2+2=4
\end{equation}

We reference Theorem [[thm:new]], and Equation [[eq:newest]].
