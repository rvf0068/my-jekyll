* Introduction

This post demonstrates the use of citations in an Org-mode Jekyll blog, along with mathematical content and online images.

Poset topology has been a fruitful area of research in combinatorics. The seminal work by Quillen [fn:quillen] established connections between group theory and topological properties of posets. Later, Björner and others developed this theory further [fn:bjorner].

* Poset Fiber Theorems

One of the most important results in poset topology is the Poset Fiber Theorem by Björner, Wachs, and Welker [fn:posetfiber]. This theorem provides powerful tools for computing homology groups of partially ordered sets.

#+begin_theorem
*(Poset Fiber Theorem)* Let $f: P \to Q$ be an order-preserving map between finite posets. If all fibers $f^{-1}(q)$ are contractible, then the induced map on geometric realizations is a homotopy equivalence.
#+end_theorem

The proof involves careful analysis of the simplicial complexes associated with the posets.

* Mathematical Content

Let's consider some equations related to the Möbius function on posets.

The Möbius function $\mu$ on a poset $P$ satisfies:

\begin{equation}
\label{org5678901}
\sum_{x \leq z \leq y} \mu(x, z) = \delta_{xy}
\end{equation}

where $\delta_{xy}$ is the Kronecker delta. This is the fundamental property \eqref{org5678901} that defines the Möbius function.

For the Boolean lattice $B_n$, we have the explicit formula:

\begin{equation}
\label{org5678902}
\mu(S, T) = (-1)^{|T| - |S|}
\end{equation}

for $S \subseteq T \subseteq [n]$. The formula \eqref{org5678902} is particularly elegant for this special case.

* Enumerative Aspects

As discussed in Stanley's comprehensive treatise [fn:stanley], enumerative combinatorics provides powerful tools for counting. The chromatic polynomial of a graph can be computed using:

\begin{equation}
\label{org5678903}
\chi(G, k) = \sum_{S \subseteq E} (-1)^{|S|} k^{c(S)}
\end{equation}

where $c(S)$ denotes the number of connected components in the subgraph with edge set $S$.

* Visual Examples

Here's an image showing the Hasse diagram of a partially ordered set (from Wikipedia):

And here's another example showing a simplicial complex (from Wikimedia Commons):

These diagrams illustrate the geometric realization of abstract combinatorial structures.

* Applications

The techniques developed in these papers have found applications in:

1. Group theory (studying subgroup lattices)
2. Representation theory (understanding character values)
3. Algebraic topology (computing homology groups)
4. Discrete Morse theory (analyzing critical cells)

The interplay between combinatorics and topology continues to be a rich source of mathematical insights.
