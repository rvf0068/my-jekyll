<p>
This is just a test:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python">class Clique(frozenset):
    """
    Base class for a clique in a graph.

    This class is derived from frozenset, but we modify its representation so
    that it does not print the word 'frozenset'.
    """
    def __repr__(self):
        u = set(self)
        if len(u) == 0:
            return "{}"
        else:
            return f"{u}"
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Is it justified to define a class like the previous one? Or is there another simpler data structure in the standard library that we could use?
</p>

<p>
This is Gemini's answer:
</p>

<p>
Yes, defining such a class is justified. Your goal is to change the string representation for readability, which is a common reason to subclass a built-in type.
</p>

<p>
The standard library has no direct alternative that is both an <b>immutable set</b> and has a <code>set</code>-like <code>__repr__</code>. <code>frozenset</code> is the correct data structure for an immutable set; your approach of subclassing it to customize its representation is the standard Pythonic way to achieve this.
</p>

<p>
Test inline math: \(a+b=c^{2}\). Test display math: \[G+H\].
</p>

<p>
This finishes the test.
